## Architecture

This project is intended to be a sample ingestion and processing pipeline. Queue items are ingested via an API with SPA frontend. Queue items are watched via KEDA and processed in a pod inside kubernetes. "Results" get saved to a storage table. The frontend and backend both use AAD JWT token auth.
